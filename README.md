# 42_21_philosophers
My Implementation of the Dining Philosophers project at School21, Russia.

**Summary** " In this project, you will learn the basics of threading a process. You will
learn how to make threads. You will discover the mutex"
**Description** philosopher with threads and mutex

**Operating system**, using resources...
Philosophers represent processess, the forks represent resources to be shared between processes in a synchroniced manner without violating rules(e.g resources that may be used only one at a time...).

How can we solve this using semaphores?
